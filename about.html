<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hello World</h2>
<p>I am Aditi Verma, working as a Web Designer. My age is 28 and i am from a small town called "Mahoba" which is located
   in Uttarpradesh INDIA. Currently i am living in Greater Noida. Like you all i am also having big dreams which i know 
   one day i am going to make them come true and for that i am continuously working hard each day. </p>


<p>I have quite a lot of hobbies like ART(DIY)craft, Reading, Writting, listensing rock music, video gaming, collecting
  coin & stamp,helping all the living entities as much as i can, and always eager to learn new slills. 
  I always wanted to be a cabin crew but slowely it's fading away due to my age and lack of degrees they require. I have 
  lots of knowlege,passion and dedication but they will not hire me because they do not want knowlege they just want degree
  or experience letter. An experience letter which rich people can easy buy but middle class people like me can never.
  Still i am trying as that's the only thing in can do, sad to say but it's a harsh truth that these days talent have no 
  worth without a degree, dosen't matter how talented you are without a degree or an experience letter you are nothing.
  I decided to be a Web Designer because in this feild it's not necessary to have a B.tech degree to work in a tech feild,
  they vaulue the talent you got. As soon as you learn the skill required you are ready to work without any degree.
</p>

<p>What do i think of myself?
  I think that i am a very strong person who never giveup no matter how hard the situation is and i know one day i am going 
  to fullfil all my dreams and i want you also to never fall apart because this world is really magical and everthing is
  possibe if you want to make it possibe. You know what real magic resides within your brain use that sub-consious mind of yours, 
  explore this world more,do what makes you happy and work hard towards your future goals this is the time as we only live
  once, have faith in yourself and more forward.
</p>

<p>At last i wanna say this life is all about you, your experience matters so without thinking a lot live your life to the fullest
   so that there should be no regrets when you are on your deaths bed, I surely do not want you to die but it's the harsh truth
    which everyone should be always aware of.</p>
